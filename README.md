This is the main files to start development projects in PHP with CodeIgniter.
Already set the autoload of views, just have fun!

Default folder structure:

1. Images in `assets/images`
2. CSS in `assets/stylesheets`
3. JS in `assets/javascripts`
4. Webfonts in `assets/fonts`

Some features:

1. Autoloading the view, like Rails does. `application/(controller)/(action)`
2. ORM Datamapper included
3. Extra fun on development!
